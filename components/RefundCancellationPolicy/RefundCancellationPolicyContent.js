              government guidelines, do we get any adjustment or refund?

              All our training centers have to follow the guidelines as given by
              the school/sports complex and the respective state government or
              local authorities. As there is a rise the cases of Covid-19 in
              many states - many schools and sports complexes are closed for an
              interim period and we shall keep the parents informed regarding
              the same through Parent Whatsapp Group*.

              Q5: I do not intend to send my ward for online sessions (for
              personal reasons), do we get adjustments in this case?

              In case you do not wish to participate in the online training
              sessions for personal reasons, we completely understand your
              decision. We shall provide the required adjustment for the
              sessions missed for the reasons mentioned above (only), however,
              we would encourage you to give an opportunity for your ward to
              attend these classes to avoid discontinuity in her training and
              ensure that she stays connected with her peer group through this
              digital medium. You may also use the train-at-home feature of our
              app (enJogo) for regular workouts during such cancellations.
